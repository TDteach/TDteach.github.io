# AI Paper Insight Brief
## 2026-02-27

### 0) Executive takeaways (read this first)
- **Agent safety is shifting from “prompt-level” to “systems-level”**: edge/IoT deployments and tool-augmented agents introduce new, measurable failure modes (provenance forgery, audit blind spots, silent data egress) that aren’t addressed by model-only defenses.  
- **Inference-time, training-free alignment/safety is maturing** in multiple directions: policy-grounded debate for rapid policy swaps (CourtGuard), causal counterfactual diagnostics for indirect prompt injection (AgentSentry), and sparse weight editing for multilingual safety transfer (Sparse Weight Editing).
- **GRPO is becoming a common backbone** across agentic RAG training, adaptive thinking, and industrial faithfulness RL—papers increasingly focus on *stability/credit assignment* (advantage shaping, length-aware gradients, path-centric rewards) rather than just “apply RL”.
- **Long-horizon agents are hitting infrastructure limits** (KV cache growth, memory/retrieval brittleness, stochasticity). New work shows large serving wins via model-driven KV eviction (SideQuest) and hardware-aware KV quantization layout (InnerQ), plus new benchmarks/metrics for memory and stochasticity (AMA-Bench; DRA stochasticity TV).
- **Evaluation methodology is under active repair**: auditing hidden behaviors now has a systematic agentic benchmark (AuditBench), while human rating noise is shown to *change system rankings* when modeled (IRT/MFRM) and physician disagreement in HealthBench is largely case-specific (residual-dominated).
- **Biosecurity risk evidence is getting more realistic**: a human uplift study finds novices with LLM access are **4.16× more accurate** than internet-only novices on dual-use in silico biology tasks, and most report little difficulty overcoming safeguards.

### 2) Key themes (clusters)

### Theme: Systems-level agent security (tool boundaries, edge deployments, causal takeovers)
**Why it matters:** As agents move into physical and tool-rich environments, the dominant risks increasingly come from *coordination planes, fallback paths, and untrusted tool outputs*, not just prompt injection in a single chat turn.

**Representative papers**
- Systems-Level Attack Surface of Edge Agent Deployments on IoT — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22525v1  
- AgentSentry: Mitigating Indirect Prompt Injection… — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22724v1  
- ESAA: Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents… — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23193v1  

**Common approach**
- Define **architecture-specific threat surfaces** (e.g., MQTT as command plane; tool-return boundaries as intervention points).
- Add **measurable operational metrics** (actuation-to-audit delay; provenance completeness; failover windows; egress volume).
- Use **inference-time controls**: counterfactual “shadow runs” + context purification (AgentSentry); contract-validated intentions + deterministic replay (ESAA).
- Emphasize **continuation under defense** (purify/gate actions) rather than terminate-on-suspicion.

**Open questions / failure modes**
- Overhead and scalability: AgentSentry’s counterfactual regimes add extra invocations per boundary; edge monitoring gaps can be multi-second under failover.
- Trust anchors: MQTT brokers accepting spoof/replay/direct publishes show provenance can be “100% complete” yet meaningless without enforcement.
- Benchmark coverage: current IPI benchmarks may under-represent long-horizon, delayed takeovers; edge testbeds are small and topology-specific.
- Governance vs utility: strict contracts/replay improve auditability, but quality/coverage vs standard SE benchmarks isn’t established in ESAA.

### Theme: Rapid, training-free (or low-touch) safety adaptation across policies and languages
**Why it matters:** Deployed systems face shifting policies and multilingual jailbreak surfaces; retraining-based alignment lags operational needs.

**Representative papers**
- CourtGuard: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Zero-Shot Policy Adaptation… — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22557v1  
- Multilingual Safety Alignment Via Sparse Weight Editing — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22554v1  

**Common approach**
- **Inference-time policy grounding** via RAG + structured adjudication (attacker/defender debate + judge with threat scores).
- **Training-free parameter edits**: sparse neuron selection + closed-form low-rank updates to align LRL harmful representations to an English safety target.
- Evaluate across **multiple backbones and languages/policies**, and test composition with existing methods (e.g., MPO + edits).

**Open questions / failure modes**
- Policy-grounded systems trade off **latency vs adaptability** and depend on backbone formatting adherence (CourtGuard).
- Multilingual benchmarks are **translation-constructed** and rely on an automated guard model; robustness to adaptive attacks is unresolved (Sparse Weight Editing).
- How to validate “policy correctness” and “safety transfer” with **human evaluation** at scale remains unclear in these setups.

---

### Theme: RL for agentic RAG and reasoning efficiency—denser rewards + stability fixes
**Why it matters:** RL is increasingly used to shape agent behavior, but sparse outcome rewards and length heterogeneity destabilize training and can harm accuracy.

**Representative papers**
- Search-P1: Path-Centric Reward Shaping for Stable and Efficient Agentic RAG Training — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22576v1  
- Stable Adaptive Thinking via Advantage Shaping and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22556v1  
- Compress the Easy, Explore the Hard… Difficulty-Aware Entropy Regularization — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22642v1  
- Towards Faithful Industrial RAG… Reinforced Co-adaptation for Advertising QA — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22584v1  

**Common approach**
- Use **GRPO-style RL** and focus on *process-level* signals:
  - Path-centric rewards with self-consistency + reference-alignment; soft partial credit (Search-P1).
  - Advantage shaping to avoid penalizing correct long reasoning; length-aware gradient reweighting (Adaptive Thinking).
  - Selective entropy regularization for hard instances + per-question dynamic length baselines (CEEH).
  - Multi-dimensional rewards including faithfulness/style/safety/URL validity (Industrial RAG).
- Explicitly measure **accuracy–token/latency trade-offs** and convergence speed.

**Open questions / failure modes**
- Reliance on **LLM evaluators** (Search-P1; industrial RL judging) introduces sensitivity and potential reward hacking.
- Length control can still risk **entropy collapse** or under-exploration if difficulty estimation is wrong (CEEH).
- Industrial gains come with **latency increases** (A/B test shows 2.5s→3.1s) and unclear generalization beyond the domain.

### Theme: Long-horizon agent infrastructure—memory, KV cache, and stochasticity as first-class bottlenecks
**Why it matters:** As agents run longer, reliability and cost are dominated by context growth, retrieval failures, and run-to-run variance—not just model accuracy.

**Representative papers**
- SideQuest: Model-Driven KV Cache Management… — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22603v1  
- InnerQ: Hardware-aware Tuning-free Quantization of KV Cache… — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23200v1  
- AMA-Bench: Evaluating Long-Horizon Memory for Agentic Applications — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22769v1  
- Evaluating Stochasticity in Deep Research Agents — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23271v1  

**Common approach**
- Treat infrastructure as **learned/optimized**, not heuristic:
  - Model-driven eviction via parallel auxiliary thread (SideQuest).
  - Quantization layout aligned to decode-time matmul (InnerQ).
- Build **agent-centric benchmarks** (trajectory logs, causal/state questions) rather than dialogue-only memory tests (AMA-Bench).
- Define **variance metrics** over answers/findings/citations and attribute variance to modules and time steps (DRA stochasticity).

**Open questions / failure modes**
- SideQuest currently evicts only **tool outputs**, not “thought” tokens; OOD accuracy drops up to 5%.
- InnerQ evidence is limited to GSM8K few-shot + matmul microbenchmarks on a single GPU/batch size.
- Memory systems still lose information during **construction/compression**; similarity retrieval is unreliable in needle settings (AMA-Bench).
- Even temperature=0 can be non-deterministic in APIs; mitigation needs algorithmic controls (DRA stochasticity).

---

### Theme: Evaluation and auditing—benchmarks for hidden behaviors + correcting human disagreement
**Why it matters:** Safety and capability claims are increasingly limited by evaluation artifacts: hidden behaviors, rater effects, and irreducible expert disagreement.

**Representative papers**
- AuditBench: Evaluating Alignment Auditing Techniques on Models with Hidden Behaviors — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22755v1  
- Correcting Human Labels for Rater Effects… IRT Approach — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22585v1  
- Decomposing Physician Disagreement in HealthBench — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22758v1  

**Common approach**
- Move from single-model “organisms” to **systematic suites** (56 models × 14 behaviors; varied instillation/adversarial training).
- Evaluate **end-to-end investigator agents**, not just tool signal (AuditBench’s tool-to-agent gap).
- Apply **psychometric models** (Many-Facet Rasch) to separate latent quality from rater severity/centrality.
- Use **variance decomposition** to locate disagreement sources (physician vs rubric vs residual; disagreement vs label variance).

**Open questions / failure modes**
- AuditBench targets are fine-tunes on one base model; tool effectiveness may differ on other families.
- MFRM estimation depends on overlap/linkage; short scales and sparse ratings limit certainty.
- HealthBench disagreement is largely residual; many proposed predictors barely explain variance, suggesting a ceiling unless task design changes.

### Theme: Dual-use and privacy risks from agentic capability
**Why it matters:** Agentic tool use and multi-model access can amplify both harmful capability (bio uplift) and privacy attacks (deanonymization), shifting risk assessments.

**Representative papers**
- LLM Novice Uplift on Dual-Use, In Silico Biology Tasks — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23329v1  
- Assessing Deanonymization Risks with Stylometry-Assisted LLM Agent — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23079v1  
- Decomposing Private Image Generation via Coarse-to-Fine Wavelet Modeling — https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23262v1  

**Common approach**
- Evaluate **realistic attacker/novice workflows** (hours-long tasks; candidate search + sample collection; DP training constraints).
- Combine **tooling + structured signals** (stylometric metrics grounding LLM comparisons; wavelet decomposition to focus DP on coarse structure).
- Provide **mitigations**: guided recomposition reduces attribution success; DP post-processing preserves privacy after DP coarse generation.

**Open questions / failure modes**
- Bio uplift is in silico; translation to wet-lab capability remains open.
- Deanonymization open-world accuracy remains low even with DB augmentation; domain/language generality is limited.
- DP-Wavelet assumes high-frequency details can be safely synthesized from public priors; strict ε=1 still degrades quality.

---

### 3) Technical synthesis
- **GRPO is the shared optimization substrate** across adaptive thinking, agentic RAG reward shaping, and industrial faithfulness RL—innovation is shifting to *advantage shaping, gradient regulation, and process rewards* rather than new RL algorithms.
- Multiple papers converge on **process-level supervision**: Search-P1’s path rewards, Adaptive Thinking’s CPAS, and diffusion “stitching” (below) all try to reuse partial correctness rather than discard failed trajectories.
- **Inference-time “meta-reasoning” is becoming modular**: CourtGuard (policy debate), AgentSentry (counterfactual diagnostics), SideQuest (auxiliary KV management thread) all add parallel/auxiliary reasoning loops around a base model.
- **Long-horizon reliability is being operationalized** with new metrics: actuation-to-audit delay and failover windows (IoT edge), normalized total variance over findings/citations (DRA stochasticity), and agent-trajectory memory categories (AMA-Bench).
- **Tool-use is both a capability lever and a vulnerability surface**: SMTL pushes parallel tool execution for efficiency; AgentSentry treats tool-return boundaries as causal choke points; IoT edge work shows the messaging plane (MQTT) can become the de facto control plane.
- **Evaluation is increasingly “agentic”**: AuditBench measures whether an investigator agent can use tools effectively; General Agent Evaluation (Unified Protocol/Exgentic) shows model choice dominates success variance and tool limits can zero out performance.
- **Mechanistic/representation interventions are diversifying**: sparse weight edits for multilingual safety; attribution probes for parametric vs contextual reliance; SSM bottleneck steering via activation subspaces; certified stability for vision circuits under dataset edits.
- **Serving efficiency work is aligning with agent workloads**: SideQuest targets tool-output-heavy contexts; InnerQ targets decode-time matmul patterns; both aim to reclaim throughput without breaking long-horizon coherence.

### 4) Top 5 papers (with “why now”)

1) **AgentSentry: Mitigating Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents via Temporal Causal Diagnostics and Context Purification**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22724v1  
- Introduces a **boundary-anchored counterfactual protocol** (orig/mask/mask_sanitized/orig_sanitized) to estimate per-boundary causal effects (ACE/IE/DE).  
- Achieves **ASR = 0%** across three IPI families and multiple black-box models on AgentDojo, while maintaining reported utility and **FPR = 0%** in tables.  
- Key utility: offers a concrete path from “detect injection” to **safe continuation** via causally gated purification + action gating.  
- Skepticism: adds inference overhead (extra runs per boundary) and benchmarks may under-cover long-horizon delayed takeovers.

2) **Systems-Level Attack Surface of Edge Agent Deployments on IoT**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22525v1  
- Makes edge-agent security **measurable** (latency to audit, provenance completeness, sovereignty/egress, failover windows).  
- Empirically shows default MQTT coordination can accept **spoof/replay/malformed** messages, and failover can create **~35.7s** monitoring blind spots.  
- Key utility: reframes “agent safety” for physical systems as **architecture + infrastructure security**, not just prompt defenses.  
- Skepticism: single small testbed; no mitigation prototypes evaluated; cloud egress comparison not workload-matched.

3) **AuditBench: Evaluating Alignment Auditing Techniques on Models with Hidden Behaviors**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22755v1  
- Provides **56 concealed-behavior targets** across 14 behavior types with varied instillation/adversarial training.  
- Evaluates **end-to-end investigator agents** and documents a **tool-to-agent gap**; scaffolded black-box tools perform best overall.  
- Key utility: turns auditing into a repeatable benchmark where tool choices can be compared under different concealment regimes.  
- Skepticism: targets are fine-tunes on a single base model; may not reflect naturally emerging hidden behaviors.

4) **SideQuest: Model-Driven KV Cache Management for Long-Horizon Agentic Reasoning**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22603v1  
- Uses the model itself in a **parallel auxiliary thread** to delete stale tool outputs from KV cache without polluting main context.  
- Reports **56–65% peak token utilization reduction** and **83.9% throughput increase** on FRAMES serving (H100, SGLang).  
- Key utility: directly addresses the serving bottleneck for deep research/web agents where tool outputs dominate context.  
- Skepticism: limited fine-tuning data (215 traces) and eviction is restricted to tool responses; OOD accuracy drops up to 5%.

5) **LLM Novice Uplift on Dual-Use, In Silico Biology Tasks**  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23329v1  
- Human-subject evidence that LLM access yields **4.16× higher novice accuracy** than internet-only, across 7/8 benchmarks.  
- Shows novices with LLMs can **exceed expert baselines** on some suites, and most participants report **no difficulty overcoming safeguards**.  
- Key utility: shifts bio-risk discussion from model-only benchmarks to **realistic multi-model, long-horizon uplift**.  
- Skepticism: not double-blind; some question leakage occurred; results are limited to in silico tasks (wet-lab translation unknown).

### 5) Practical next steps
- For tool-augmented agents, implement **tool-return boundary instrumentation**: log mediator content, proposed actions, and add a lightweight counterfactual/sanitization check (even if not full AgentSentry) to detect “mediator takeover” patterns.
- If deploying edge/IoT agents, treat the messaging plane (e.g., MQTT) as **safety-critical C2**: measure actuation-to-audit delay, provenance completeness, and failover blackout windows; test spoof/replay acceptance explicitly.
- For policy compliance teams, prototype **policy-grounded adjudication** (RAG + structured verdict + threat scores) and measure latency/formatting failure rates across candidate backbones.
- For multilingual safety, test **training-free edits** on your own multilingual jailbreak set and track utility drift on core tasks; separately validate with at least two harm classifiers if possible (guard sensitivity is a known issue).
- For long-horizon serving, benchmark **KV interventions** on your agent traces: (a) model-driven eviction (SideQuest-style) for tool outputs, and/or (b) KV quantization layout changes (InnerQ-style) to see if decode-time speedups translate end-to-end.
- Add **stochasticity tracking** for deep research agents: compute run-to-run variance over findings/citations; test structured summarization outputs and early query ensembling/intersection to reduce propagated variance.
- If you rely on human ratings, run a quick **rater-effect audit** (severity/centrality) and check whether model rankings change under an MFRM-style adjustment; for medical evals, tag “reducible uncertainty” cases to target rubric/context fixes.
